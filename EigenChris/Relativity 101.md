# Relativity 101: Introduction 

The video series provides an in-depth exploration of relativity, starting with Galilean relativity's application to everyday velocities and evolving to special relativity's implications at near-light speeds, fundamentally changing our understanding of time, space, and gravity through historical development, mathematical principles, and empirical verification.

This video series on relativity, aimed at individuals with a foundational understanding of calculus, linear algebra, and physics, endeavors to elucidate the mathematical principles of general relativity, covering phenomena such as black holes, the universe's expansion, gravitational time dilation, and gravitational waves. Spanning several hours, the series starts with "Relativity 101" videos, offering an accessible introduction without heavy reliance on mathematics. It traces the evolution of relativity from Galileo's observations in the 17th century to Einstein's groundbreaking theories of special and general relativity in the 20th century, explaining how these theories apply to different frames of reference, including inertial and accelerating frames, and how they form the basis for understanding the fabric of the universe and its phenomena.

Transitioning from the concept of Galilean relativity, which pertains to everyday life, this video delves into special relativity, observable at velocities nearing the speed of light. Rooted in the 19th century through Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, special relativity confronts the enigma of light's constant speed `c` in a vacuum, challenging the notion of a stationary aether and Galilean relativity's framework. Einstein's groundbreaking postulates—that the laws of physics hold constant across all inertial frames and that light's speed remains invariant in these frames—lay the foundation for special relativity. This theory significantly alters our perception of time and space, making them relative rather than absolute, and introduces phenomena like time dilation and length contraction. Verified by observing muons from cosmic rays, special relativity's predictions confirm its validity, highlighting its applicability at high velocities and paving the way for the exploration of general relativity to address gravity's role in the fabric of spacetime.
