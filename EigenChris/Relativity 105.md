# Relativity 105: Acceleration 



The series of videos covers the intricacies of acceleration in both special and general relativity, from debunking misconceptions about special relativity's handling of acceleration and non-inertial frames to explaining Rindler coordinates, the covariant derivative in flat spacetime, and the nature of geodesic curves and their significance in describing the trajectories of inertial frames and light beams across various reference frames, thereby enriching the understanding of spacetime's structure and observer-relative phenomena.

The video clarifies a common misconception about special relativity's inability to address accelerating objects or frames, explaining that while special relativity fully encompasses acceleration and non-inertial frames within flat spacetime, ignoring gravity, general relativity extends the framework to include gravity, considering it as curvature in spacetime. It distinguishes between the two by highlighting special relativity's application to inertial frames with constant velocity and its accommodation of acceleration through hyperbolic motion and the introduction of the Rindler horizon, a concept illustrating how accelerated frames perceive light and distances differently, akin to the event horizon of a black hole, yet distinct in its reversibility upon deceleration.

This video extends the discussion on acceleration within special relativity through Bell's spaceship paradox, leading to the development of Rindler coordinates, the first set of curvilinear coordinates introduced in this series. Bell's spaceship paradox, like other special relativity paradoxes (e.g., the twin and ladder paradoxes), initially seems to challenge the theory but actually underscores its validity upon closer examination. The paradox involves two spaceships tied by a string, accelerating identically according to an observer (Einstein), raising the question of whether the string breaks due to the spaceships' length contraction. In Newtonian physics, objects under constant acceleration follow a parabolic trajectory, maintaining the distance between them as seen by a stationary observer. However, in special relativity, identical acceleration results in hyperbolic trajectories, where distances appear constant to the stationary observer but not to those on the spaceships, suggesting the string would break. Alternatively, if the spaceships adjust their acceleration to maintain constant distance in their frames, the string remains intact. This insight leads to Rindler coordinates, which describe the perspective of an observer undergoing constant proper acceleration, introducing a space-time coordinate system for non-inertial frames that differ significantly from inertial frame descriptions.

This video introduces the concept of basis vectors and the Jacobian for curvilinear coordinates, crucial for navigating the mathematics of non-inertial frames in special relativity and the curved spacetime of general relativity. It emphasizes the dual nature of vectors, composed of both basis vectors and vector components, and how changes in one are inversely related to changes in the other across various transformations (scaling, Galilean, Lorentz). In the context of special relativity, accelerating objects exhibit a different spacetime basis at each point along their curved world lines, requiring the Jacobian matrix to transition between inertial and non-inertial frames. The Jacobian matrix facilitates this by adjusting basis vectors, while its inverse adjusts vector components. The video also revisits the multivariable chain rule and interprets basis vectors as tangent vectors along coordinate curves, providing a foundation to understand the Jacobian matrix's role in transforming vectors between coordinate systems like the standard spacetime and Rindler coordinates. Through examples, it demonstrates how the Jacobian and its inverse are used to translate four-velocity vectors between different observers' frames in special relativity, illustrating the mathematical framework that underpins observations in both inertial and accelerating reference frames.

In this video, the Twin Paradox and the calculation of proper time along curved worldlines using the Minkowski and Rindler metric tensor matrices are explored. The Twin Paradox, involving two observers, Alice (who remains on Earth) and Bob (who travels at near-light speed), is used to illustrate a misconception in special relativity regarding moving clocks and relative motion. It clarifies that special relativity only deems all inertial frames as equivalent, not non-inertial frames, which is crucial for understanding why Bob ages less than Alice during his journey. The video then delves into calculating proper time in relativity, starting with the definition of proper time Ï„ as the time measured by a clock traveling with the observer. It introduces the Minkowski metric for inertial frames and the Rindler metric for accelerating frames, explaining that the proper time calculation depends on the path taken through spacetime, not just the start and end points. By applying the concept to the Twin Paradox, it demonstrates that Alice experiences more proper time due to her inertial frame, while Bob's non-inertial path results in less proper time accumulated. This difference underscores that not all frames are equivalent in special relativity, resolving the paradox and highlighting the fundamental nature of proper time calculation across different spacetime paths and coordinate systems.


## Relativity 105e: Acceleration - Covariant Derivative in Flat Spacetime (Rindler Coordinates)

This video delves into the concept of the covariant derivative in the context of flat spacetime, crucial for understanding derivatives in non-inertial frames where basis vectors are not constant. It begins by differentiating four vectors like velocity and acceleration in inertial frames, straightforward due to constant basis vectors. However, in non-inertial frames, such as Rindler coordinates used for accelerating observers, basis vectors vary across spacetime, necessitating the inclusion of their derivatives when computing the covariant derivative of a vector. The video explains the procedure through examples in Rindler coordinates, emphasizing the need to account for the derivatives of both vector components and basis vectors to correctly calculate the covariant derivative. This is achieved by employing the product rule and multivariable chain rule, leading to the introduction of Christoffel symbols, which encapsulate changes in basis vectors across different points in spacetime. These symbols play a key role in the calculation, representing the derivatives of basis vectors with respect to coordinate variables, and are fundamental in transitioning from inertial to non-inertial frames. The video concludes by highlighting the importance of the covariant derivative in ensuring calculations are valid across any coordinate system, thus maintaining physical consistency in both flat and curved spacetimes.

This video explores the concept of geodesic curves, which represent the trajectories that inertial frames and light beams follow in both special and general relativity. It clarifies that while we often visualize inertial observers and light beams as moving along straight lines in spacetime diagrams, this portrayal only strictly applies from the perspective of inertial reference frames. The video explains that in non-inertial frames, such as those described by Rindler coordinates for observers with constant proper acceleration, both inertial observers and light beams can appear to follow curved paths. Specifically, it demonstrates how, in Rindler coordinates, an inertial observer's path can resemble a hyperbolic secant curve, while a light beam's path looks exponential. The video introduces the geodesic equation, which mathematically defines geodesics as world lines where the second derivative of the four-position vector with respect to a path parameter is zero, encompassing both inertial paths (with zero proper acceleration) and light-like paths. It further illustrates how to solve for geodesic curves in Rindler coordinates using Christoffel symbols, highlighting the adaptability of the geodesic equation to any coordinate system, whether inertial or non-inertial, thus providing a universal description of motion in spacetime.
