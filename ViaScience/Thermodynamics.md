The first video in the thermodynamics series introduces the concept of heat and temperature, tracing the historical understanding of heat from its classical elemental classification to modern theories of particle motion and energy transfer. It discusses the sun's role as a primary heat source, humanity's mastery over fire for heat and light, and the development of thermodynamics spurred by steam engine innovation. Various historical theories, such as phlogiston and caloric, are explored alongside significant contributions by scientists like Lavoisier, Thompson, and others who helped transition the understanding of heat from a substance to a process of particle motion. The video also explains the development of temperature measurement, from early gas thermoscopes to the precision of mercury-in-glass thermometers by Fahrenheit, culminating in the establishment of the Celsius scale and the concept of absolute zero on the Kelvin scale.

Early thermal science distinguished temperature from heat quantity through the development of heat capacity and specific heat concepts, illustrating that different materials require varying amounts of heat to change temperature. This differentiation was highlighted in Fahrenheit’s mixing experiments, leading to the understanding that heat capacity is the ratio of heat added to the resulting temperature change, with specific heat as an inherent property of materials, describing how much heat per mass is needed to change its temperature by one degree Celsius. Experiments, like those by James Joule, further linked mechanical energy to heat, establishing the mechanical equivalent of heat and laying the groundwork for the first law of thermodynamics, thus enabling a more rigorous theory of thermodynamics to be developed.

The video introduces thermodynamics related to ideal gases, starting with an experiment using a simple gas thermometer to establish the linear relationship between volume and temperature, leading to the concept of absolute zero at -273.15°C and the Kelvin temperature scale. Historical gas laws such as Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, Gay-Lussac's Law, and Avogadro's Law are recounted, emphasizing their empirical origins and relevance to understanding gas behavior under various conditions. The kinetic theory of gases is introduced, explaining gas laws through molecular motion, where pressure and volume relationships are derived from the mechanics of molecular collisions. This theory ties together the macroscopic gas laws with microscopic molecular behaviors, illustrating how temperature influences molecular speed and, consequently, gas pressure and volume. The discussion underscores the foundational role of kinetic energy and molecular motion in linking temperature with gas properties, setting the stage for more advanced discussions on thermodynamics and gas behavior.
