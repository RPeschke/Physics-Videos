## What is Galilean Relativity?

Galilean relativity, introduced by Galileo in 1632, is a foundational concept in physics that addresses how different observers perceive the same physical events depending on their states of motion. This form of relativity is particularly concerned with inertial frames of reference, where observers are either at rest or moving at a constant velocity. Through examples such as a person on a moving train throwing a ball, Galilean relativity illustrates that both observers, whether moving with the train or standing stationary, correctly perceive the motion according to their own frame of reference. The mathematical formulation of this concept, known as the Galilean transformation, helps reconcile these differing observations by relating the distances and velocities observed in one frame to those in another. Crucially, Galilean relativity underscores the principle of Galilean invariance, asserting that the laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames. This principle forms the basis for Newton's laws of motion and the broader field of classical mechanics, guiding our understanding of everything from everyday transportation to architectural engineering and space exploration.


## Calculus Crash Course I: Derivatives

Understanding basic Newtonian physics hinges on grasping two fundamental concepts from calculus: derivatives and integrals. Derivatives help us understand how something changes at an instant—like how fast a car speeds up or slows down at any given moment. Imagine you're watching a car race; a derivative would tell you exactly how quickly each car is accelerating right as they pass by. On the other hand, integrals allow us to accumulate these tiny changes over time or space, like calculating the total distance a car travels by adding up all its little speed changes throughout the race.

In simpler terms, if we consider a function to represent a curved path, like a hill, the derivative at any point on that hill tells us how steep the hill is right there. So, if you were walking along this path, the derivative would tell you how steeply you'd be climbing or descending at any step. As for integrals, they're like asking how much ground you've covered or how much area is under the path you walked from start to finish.

To make these concepts more tangible, let's think about how we describe the motion of objects. If you throw a ball, the derivative of the ball's position over time tells us its speed and how it changes, capturing the essence of its motion. When we look at how this speed changes over the entire journey of the ball from your hand to the ground, we're thinking along the lines of integration.

These mathematical tools are not just abstract concepts; they're the language physics uses to describe the universe. From the way planets orbit the sun to understanding how a bridge withstands its load, derivatives and integrals are key to unlocking the mysteries of motion and change in the world around us.


## How to Get Classical Physics from Quantum Mechanics

The journey from classical to quantum physics unveils the fundamental principles governing the universe's dynamics. Initially, classical physics relied on Newton's laws to predict system behavior based on initial conditions. Yet, complex systems made calculating forces and accelerations challenging, prompting the search for simpler methods. Enter the method of least action, utilizing the action functional and Lagrangian, which elegantly derives equations of motion without directly handling forces. This approach, rooted in the variational principle, mirrors Fermat's principle in optics, emphasizing paths that minimize action, akin to light's least-time paths. However, the physical interpretation of the Lagrangian, crucial for understanding system evolution, remained elusive until quantum mechanics offered clarity. Quantum mechanics, particularly through Feynman's path integrals, suggests all possible paths contribute to a particle's movement, with the path minimizing action dominating in the classical limit. This quantum perspective not only provides a physical basis for the Lagrangian but also demystifies how particles "choose" their path, bridging classical intuitions with quantum reality. Thus, quantum mechanics enriches our understanding of classical principles, revealing the universe's subtleties through the elegant dance of probabilities and actions.


## How to Visualize Quantum Field Theory

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) represents a monumental advancement in 20th-century physics, successfully merging special relativity and quantum mechanics to underpin modern particle physics, including quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model, and beyond. A quantum field extends the concept of classical fields, like electric fields, into the quantum realm, applying quantum mechanics rules to continuous entities that have specific values at every point in space and time. This leap introduces the idea of fields that, while quantum in nature—implying discreteness—are nevertheless continuous across space and time. Using the analogy of a string or a ring of harmonic oscillators, QFT reveals how particles, or localized units of energy within these fields, behave according to quantum mechanics. These "particles" are essentially excitations or quanta of the field, exemplified by phonons in a quantum string, which travel as localized points at fixed speeds, demonstrating how particle physics emerges from the quantum behavior of fields. This foundational theory has not only profoundly influenced particle physics but also found applications across various physics domains, showcasing its versatility and the depth of insight it provides into the universe's fundamental nature.

## Feynman Diagrams and Perturbation Theory: Calculating in Particle Physics

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is notoriously complex and many models within it, such as the Standard Model, are unsolvable with exact analytical results being out of reach. To make these theories usable, approximations are made through perturbation theory, which simplifies calculations by expanding results into an infinite sum of terms based on small values within the theory, like coupling constants. Although this creates an infinite series, practical application allows for truncation at a point where further terms would not affect experimental outcomes due to their minimal contribution relative to experimental error. Feynman diagrams simplify these calculations further by visually representing the interactions and propagations within a field theory using lines and vertices that correspond to mathematical rules derived from the theory's Lagrangian. Despite the simplification Feynman diagrams offer, they grow exponentially with complexity as the order of perturbation increases, and while they provide useful approximations for many Standard Model processes, they should not be interpreted as exact representations of particle interactions due to their basis in perturbative approximations and the existence of non-perturbative effects within QFT.



## Renormalization: The Art of Erasing Infinity

In particle physics, perturbation theory and Feynman diagrams are essential tools for approximating calculations that are otherwise intractable, but they often result in problematic infinities. These infinities arise from integrating over all possible values of internal momenta in loop diagrams, leading to ultraviolet (UV) divergences. The technique of renormalization addresses these issues by redefining parameters such as coupling constants, masses, and field normalizations through scale factors called renormalization constants. This process allows for the cancellation of infinities and yields meaningful, finite results from seemingly misbehaved calculations. Renormalization is not merely a mathematical trick but a necessary and valid approach to deal with the infinities inherent in quantum field theories. It involves adjusting parameters within the theory to eliminate divergences and relies on the renormalization group equations to ensure physical observables are independent of the arbitrary energy scale introduced during regularization. This methodology splits theories into renormalizable and non-renormalizable classes, with the former requiring a finite number of interactions to cancel all divergences and the latter an infinite number, the latter being seen as effective theories valid up to a certain energy scale. Renormalization is a critical process in particle physics, enabling the field to make accurate predictions and understand the universe at a fundamental level.
