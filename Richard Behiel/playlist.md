The video explains why the Schrödinger equation is not compatible with special relativity and previews what happens when relativistic effects are accounted for. It begins with the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation for a free electron, highlighting its incompatibility with relativity because it treats space and time differently. This discrepancy becomes apparent when considering the equation's predictions at relativistic speeds.

Using plane waves, which are momentum and energy eigenstates, the video explores the Schrödinger equation's predictions across a range of velocities. It demonstrates that, according to the Schrödinger equation, an electron could reach the speed of light with a finite amount of energy, which contradicts experimental evidence and the predictions of special relativity.

Special relativity predicts that as a particle's velocity approaches the speed of light, its energy approaches infinity, making it impossible to reach or exceed light speed. This is because the relativistic momentum includes the Lorentz factor, which becomes infinite at light speed. Experimental evidence from particle accelerators, like CERN's Large Electron-Positron Collider, confirms this relationship.

The video concludes by showing that the Schrödinger plane wave solutions inherently assume a classical relationship between energy, momentum, and mass. This classical view is contrasted with the relativistic view, where mass plays the role analogous to the space-time interval.

The video presents a discussion on the Klein-Gordon equation, highlighting its significance as a preliminary step towards understanding the Dirac equation, which provides a more comprehensive account of the electron, incorporating aspects of relativity and spin. The Klein-Gordon equation is positioned between the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation and the relativistic Dirac equation. It is described as a relativistic wave equation that fails to account for the electron's spin.

A standard derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation is provided, alongside comparisons with the Schrödinger equation. Attention is drawn to the concerns historically associated with the Klein-Gordon equation, such as those articulated by physicist Paul Dirac. Solutions to the equation, specifically energy-momentum eigenstates, are explored, as well as the necessity of a complex-valued momentum space wave function for Fourier transforms between momentum space and position space.

Critiques of the Klein-Gordon equation include the potential for negative probability densities and its second-order temporal nature, which deviates from the typically first-order quantum mechanical equations. Another significant critique is its lack of accommodation for particle spin, particularly the spin-1/2 characteristic of electrons.

The video concludes by reflecting on Dirac's determination to develop a satisfactory relativistic theory of the electron, leading to his formulation of the Dirac equation. Dirac's discontent with the Klein-Gordon equation was due to its shortcomings, including its incompatibility with the elegant and effective framework of quantum mechanics and its failure to incorporate spin and antimatter. Dirac's contributions are portrayed as seeking a fundamental alteration that would align with the established principles of quantum mechanics while also integrating relativity, which was achieved with the Dirac equation.

The content details the derivation of the Dirac equation and highlights its significance in the realm of quantum mechanics and special relativity. Described as having an intricate structure with profound implications, the equation is derived using three key ingredients: the mass shell condition which relates energy and momentum to the mass of a particle in any inertial frame, quantum mechanical energy and momentum operators, and the requirement that the equation must be first order in both space and time.

To reconcile these ingredients, a square root is taken of the mass shell condition, leading to the introduction of objects that do not follow the usual rules of multiplication—namely the Dirac matrices (or gamma matrices). These matrices, when combined with the energy and momentum operators, form the Dirac equation. It's noted that these matrices allow the equation to be first-order in derivatives, avoiding the issues associated with the second-order Klein-Gordon equation.

The Dirac equation, therefore, requires the wave function to be a bispinor—a mathematical object that includes a pair of spinors, each consisting of two complex numbers. These spinors represent matter and antimatter, and contain within them the properties of spin-up and spin-down states for electrons and positrons.

In summary, the derivation of the Dirac equation addresses the limitations of the Klein-Gordon equation by incorporating spin and antimatter. The resulting equation has a complex structure that provides a richer description of particles in quantum mechanics, accounting for the electron's spin and predicting the existence of antimatter.

The video discusses a solution to the Dirac equation for a particle at rest. It begins by reiterating the importance of the gamma matrices which allow for the square root of the mass shell to be taken, a key step in deriving the Dirac equation discussed in a previous video.

For the scenario of a particle at rest, the momentum is zero except for the energy term which simplifies the four-momentum to (e/c, 0, 0, 0). In this case, the Dirac equation reduces significantly as only the gamma 0 matrix remains, and the equation effectively becomes an eigenvalue problem with the wave function represented as a bispinor.

Solving for a particle at rest leads to an eigenvalue of mc^2/e for electrons (positive energy) and -mc^2/e for positrons (negative energy, which can be interpreted as positive energy antimatter). The resulting wave function for an electron at rest has the form (a, b, 0, 0), where a and b are arbitrary complex numbers. For a positron, the wave function is (0, 0, a, b).

Since the wave function is an eigenstate of both energy and momentum, it does not depend on space or time, leading to the conclusion that the components of the bispinor are constant across space and oscillate with time according to the particle's rest energy. The oscillations are represented by an exponential function with a frequency derived from the particle's mass.

The video concludes by mentioning that complex numbers, a and b, cannot be functions of space and time. They are placeholders for the wave function's constants, which can also be written as a sum of orthogonal unit spinors. The video also touches on the strange quantum behavior of electrons when measured for spin, resulting in definite spin-up or spin-down states despite being in a superposition of states beforehand.
